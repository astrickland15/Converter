# Converter
Mobile App that converts units of distance, weight, temperature, numbers, and volume

App is written in Kotlin.  Choose from a number of measurements to get a conversion precise to four decimal places.  Will tell you if entering an incorrect temperature (colder than Absolute Zero).

Due to a Kotlin restriction, can only enter a maximum number of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 if entering a whole number.  Enjoy!
